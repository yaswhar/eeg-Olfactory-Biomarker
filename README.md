# Signals & Systems Course Project

## Analysis of Phase Locking Value during Olfactory Stimulation as a Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease in EEG Signals

This repository contains my course project for the Signals & Systems course at Sharif University of Technology.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project was to identify early biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related brain disorders through analysis of EEG signals during olfactory stimulation.  

Key aspects explored:

- Understanding the link between olfactory dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's  
- Using electroencephalography (EEG) to capture brain signal patterns
- Preprocessing and analyzing EEG signals  
- Calculating phase locking value (PLV) to quantify phase synchronization between EEG channels 
- Comparing PLV responses to olfactory stimulation between Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls

### Repository Contents

The repository contains the following key files:

- `SignalsSystems_Project1402.pdf`: Original project report  
- `README.md`: This file
- `code/`: Folder containing MATLAB code files for EEG preprocessing, PLV analysis, and result visualization
- `data/`: Sample input EEG data provided for analysis  
- `results/`: Key output plots and visualizations generated from analysis

### Running the Analysis

To rerun the analysis:

1. Ensure MATLAB is installed
2. Open `code/run_analysis.m` script  
3. Set input and output paths as needed 
4. Run script to execute preprocessing and PLV computation on sample data
5. Output results will be saved to `results/` folder
